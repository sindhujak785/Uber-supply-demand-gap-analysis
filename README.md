# ðŸš• Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Business Understanding

Traveling to and from the airport is a common experience for many people. Often, users rely on cab services like Uber for this journey. However, many customers face two major problems:
- The ride gets **cancelled by the driver**
- Or **no cars are available** when needed

These customer pain points also impact Uberâ€™s business. Every missed ride leads to **loss of revenue** and **poor customer experience**.

ðŸ‘‰ **Goal**:  
The aim of this analysis is to **identify the root causes** behind trip cancellations and car unavailability â€” and to provide **data-backed recommendations** to minimize the supply-demand gap.
